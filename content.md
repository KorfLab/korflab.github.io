KorfLab
=======

Welcome to the home page of Ian Korf's research group at UC Davis. Our
lab uses computational methods to study problems in molecular biology.
More specifically, we are interested in the mappings from structure to
function. We are particularly interested in discerning biological signal
from biological noise. Our favorite topics include gene prediction,
intron function, gene expression, sequence alignment, protein-DNA
interactions, motif-finding, NMR analysis, genome assembly, repeat
analysis, and almost anything that mixes genotype and phenotype. We love
developing new methods in emerging disciplines but also love the
classics.

Interested in joining the lab? Great, send me an email. I look for
shared interests and passion more than a specific skill set. You don't
have to be a good programmer to join the lab (but you will have to
become one).

Clockwise from left: Hannah Lyman (vocals), Ian Korf (guitar), Keith
Fraga (bass), Osman Sharifi (drums). No, we are not actually a band but
if Ian wants his lab to appear as if they have a shoegaze album, so be
it.

## Downloads ##

You can find some of our software and teaching materials on the [KorfLab
GitHub](https://github.com/KorfLab). We have not yet moved all content
to GitHub, but hope to one day. Some of our highly accessed products are
listed below.

+ [SNAP](https://github.com/KorfLab/SNAP) gene prediction software
+ [Unix & Perl Primer for Biologists](https://github.com/KorfLab/unix_and_perl)
+ [IME](https://github.com/KorfLab/IME) intron mediated enhancement software
+ [StochHMM](https://github.com/KorfLab/StochHMM) HMM software
