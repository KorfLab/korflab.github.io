Welcome to the home page of Ian Korf's research group at UC Davis. Our lab uses
computational methods to study problems in molecular biology. More
specifically, we are interested in the mappings from structure to function. We
are particularly interested in discerning biological signal from biological
noise. Our favorite topics include alternative splicing, gene prediction,
intron function, gene expression, sequence alignment, protein-DNA interactions,
motif-finding, genome assembly, repeat analysis, and almost anything that mixes
genotype, phenotype, evolution, and algorithms. We love developing new methods
in emerging disciplines but also adore the classics.

Interested in joining the lab? Great, send me an email. I look for shared
interests and passion more than a specific skill set. You don't have to be a
good programmer to join the lab (but you will have to become one).

Clockwise from left: Hannah Lyman (vocals), Ian Korf (guitar), Keith Fraga
(bass), Osman Sharifi (drums). No, we are not actually a band but if I want my
lab to appear as if we have a shoegaze album, so be it.
